# A-StarAlgorithm
- This is a GUI version of the A Star path finding algorithm
- I have also created an executable file to directly run the main.py without going to terminal or any IDE. For this to work, you need to have the required modules already installed

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Pygame

## How to install pygame
- Open up terminal and type the following command   
  - pip install pygame 
- If you get any errors while executing the command, check whether *pip* is already installed or not.
